// LFSR for random number generation that is seeded from a metastable
// source. Yields bits at bit_ready, or fully independent words at
// word_ready.
// this randomness source should not be treated as cryptographically secure.
// it has a few known issues:
//
//  * it leaks internal state (via `out`). if at each `word_ready` indication
//    the full or partial state is used, an attacker might be able to
//    recalculate the full input stream and thus the full random stream from
//    parts of it. it would be better to only use at most a few bits per
//    `word_ready`
//  * a statistical bias in the generated metastable signal (p(0) != 0.5) is
//    not canceled perfectly in favour of having a predictable output
//    quantity. see [3] for a better solution.
//  * a simple linear feedback shift register is not a cryptographically
//    sound hash function. better use something in between `md5` and `sha512`.
//
// None the less, output data usually passes tests of rngtest [1] and
// NIST Entropy Assessment [2].
// But don't hold me accountable. Entropy quality may heavily depend on FPGA
// fabric, routing, other effects and the above mentioned algorithmic issues.
